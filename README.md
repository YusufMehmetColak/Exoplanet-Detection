## Introduction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify exoplanets based on various astronomical features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify potential exoplanets.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope and is available on Kaggle. It contains information about thousands of stellar objects and their likelihood of being exoplanets.
